Diamonds are also used in many industrial applications like cutting but it is mostly used as a gemstone. The actual price of a diamond however is determined by a gemologist after examining its various features such as its carat, cut, color, and clarity. Dimensions of a diamond is also a very important parameter to determine its worth. Nearly, 142 million carats of diamonds were produced worldwide in 2019 alone. This makes it very important to come up with some smart technique to estimate its worth.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"PMl6GmJP_w4P"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jhk7f0Fl_xop"},"source":["### Problem Statement\n","\n","A diamond distributor decided to put almost 2000 diamonds for auction.
