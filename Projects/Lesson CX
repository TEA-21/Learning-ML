RFM analysis involves calculating following three factors:\n"," - **Recency:**  How recently the customer have made their purchase.\n"," - **Frequency:**  How often customers have made their purchases.\n"," - **Monetary:** How much money customers have paid for their purchases.\n","\n","Let us understand these three factors in more detail.\n","\n","**1. Recency**\n","\n","- It indicates how recently the customer have made their purchase.\n","- It will give you the number of days that have passed since last purchase made by a customer.\n","- For example, if `recency = 10` for a particular customer, it means that the last transaction made by that customer was 10 days before.\n","\n","Consider the following rows from the given dataset:\n","\n","<img src=\"https://s3-whjr-v2-prod-bucket.whjr.online/0ff9de93-0dc3-4880-9698-e193c139b47c.PNG\"/>\n","\n","\n","From the above table, it is clearly visible that the customers having `CustomerID` as 12680 and 12462 have recently ordered some items.
