Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have $400 \\times 400$ pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi was gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.\n","\n","The dataset contains the following attributes:\n","\n","|Attribute|Description|\n","|-|-|\n","|variance| variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).|\n","|skewness| skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).|\n","|curtosis| curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous).|\n","|entropy| entropy of image (continuous).|\n","|class|0: fake bank note, 1: real bank note|\n","\n","\n","**Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication\n","\n","**Owner:** Volker Lohweg (University of Applied Sciences, Ostwestfalen-Lippe, volker.lohweg '@' hs-owl.de)\n","\n","**Donor:** Helene DÃ¶rksen (University of Applied Sciences, Ostwestfalen-Lippe, helene.doerksen '@' hs-owl.de).\n","\n","\n","**Citation:**\n","Dua, D., & Graff, C..
