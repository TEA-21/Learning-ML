The irrelevant features do not help in increasing the accuracy of a prediction model. Secondly, they also increase the training time of a model. You don't want to have either a very few features or too many of them in your prediction model.\n","\n","So, the question is **how to select features?**\n","\n","One simpler way is trial and error. You can pick **any one feature** at a time, build a prediction model and evaluate it.\n","\n","Similarly, you pick **any two features** at a time, a prediction model and evaluate it.

You have already learnt how to use RFE in the linear regression lesson(s).\n","\n","So let's try to find the optimal number of features required using RFE to build a logistic regression model to predict whether a person has heart disease.
