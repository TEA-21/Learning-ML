It reacts with haemoglobin because of which it is unable to supply oxygen to the human body. At very high concentrations of carbon monoxide, up to 40% of the haemoglobin can bind with carbon monoxide which is enough to certainly kill humans. Carbon monoxide is also known as the silent killer because it has no colour, taste or smell.\n","\n","\n","**Benzene ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6$)**\n","\n","It is a colorless or light yellow liquid at room temperature. It has a sweet odour and is highly flammable. It evaporates into the air very quickly, but its vapour is heavier than air and may sink into low-lying areas. Outdoor air contains low levels of benzene from tobacco smoke, gas stations, motor vehicle exhaust, and industrial emissions. Indoor air generally contains levels of benzene higher than those in outdoor air. The benzene in indoor air comes from products that contain benzene such as glues, paints, furniture wax, and detergents. The air around hazardous waste sites or gas stations can contain higher levels of benzene than in other areas. Tobacco smoke is also a major source of benzene.\n","\n","People who breathe in high levels of benzene may develop drowsiness, dizziness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, headaches, tremors, confusion,  unconsciousness and death (at very high levels)\n","\n","**Nitrogen Oxides ($\\text{NO}_x$) & Nitrogen Dioxide ($\\text{NO}_2$)**\n","\n","Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide together are referred to as oxides of nitrogen ($\\text{NO}_x$).\n","\n","Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant gas. When nitrogen is released during fuel combustion, it combines with oxygen atoms to create nitric oxide ($\\text{NO}$). This further combines with oxygen to create nitrogen dioxide ($\\text{NO}_2$). Nitric oxide is not considered to be hazardous to health at typical ambient concentrations, but nitrogen dioxide can be.\n","\n","$\\text{NO}_x$ gases react to form smog and acid rain as well as being central to the formation of fine particles (PM) and ground level ozone, both of which are associated with adverse health effects.\n","\n","**Ozone ($\\text{O}_3$)**\n","\n","Ozone is a colourless and odourless gas. Ground-level ozone forms when pollutants from cars and trucks, power plants, factories, and other sources come in contact with each other in heat and sunlight. Ground-level ozone is one of the biggest parts of smog, and it is usually worse in the summer months.\n","\n","Many scientific studies have linked ground-level ozone contact to such varied problems as\n","\n","- asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema\n","\n","- pneumonia or bronchitis\n","\n","- lung and throat irritation\n","\n","\n","**Non-Methane Hydrocarbons ($\\text{NMHC}$)**\n","\n","All the hydrocarbons except for methane ($\\text{CH}_4$) are collectively called Non-Methane Hydrocarbons. The elevated ambient concentration of NMHCs in an urban environment has a significant impact on climate change and human health.\n","\n","Hydrocarbons (or organic compounds) are naturally occurring substances that can be found in all living things. The solvents being emitted from manufacturing processes are considered Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). The hydrocarbons are considered volatile since they produce a vapour at room temperature and normal atmospheric pressure. VOCs are contributors to the formation of ozone and smog.  \n","\n","The mechanism for ozone production is:\n","\n","$$\\text{VOC}  +  \\text{NO}_x  +  \\text{sunlight (UV)} \\longrightarrow  \\text{O}_3$$\n","\n","Hydrocarbons are the main component of crude oil, natural gases, and most pesticides. All of these substances contribute to the greenhouse effect, and the depletion of the ozone layer. They also reduce the photosynthetic ability of plants, increase cancer rates in humans and animals, and increase the risk of respiratory illness.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k-GZ9g3LyrAg"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sirOjpuRyn0j"},"source":["#### Activity 1: Loading Data\n","\n","Let's begin the class with importing the required module and importing the time-series dataset on air quality.
