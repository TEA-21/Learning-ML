This method is known as *Single Linkage*.\n","\n","However, this is not the only option when it comes to clustering data points together. Other choices for determining distances between clusters are as follows:\n","\n","**1. Single Linkage**\n","  - In single linkage, the distance between two clusters is the shortest distance between two points in the two clusters.\n","\n","    For example, consider the following two clusters:\n","\n","   <img src=\"https://s3-whjr-v2-prod-bucket.whjr.online/c764aba8-814a-4b2b-ba62-ba9d622c264f.png\"/>\n","\n","  - In the above example, the distance between green and red clusters would be the distance between data points $2$ and $5$ as per single linkage criteria.\n","\n","\n","**2. Complete Linkage**\n","\n","  - It is the opposite of single linkage.\n","  - In complete linkage, the distance between two clusters is the farthest distance between two points in two clusters.\n","\n","    For example,\n","\n","   <img src=\"https://s3-whjr-v2-prod-bucket.whjr.online/19f57629-a87d-46c2-b283-58f89edcddca.png\"/>\n","\n","  - In the above example, the distance between green and red clusters would be the distance between data points $3$ and $6$ as per complete linkage criteria.\n","\n","\n","**3. Average Linkage**\n","  -  It is between single and complete linkage.   \n","  - In average linkage, the distance between two clusters is the average distance between every point of one cluster to every other point of the other cluster.\n","\n","**4. Centroid Linkage**\n","  - In centroid linkage, the distance between two clusters is the distance between centroids of those clusters.\n","\n","  <img src=\"https://s3-whjr-v2-prod-bucket.whjr.online/949bfe9d-3eb7-41c5-8163-3dc4b6496121.png\"/>\n","\n","**5. Ward Linkage**\n"," - This approach  is same as Average Linkage except that Ward's method calculates the sum of the square of the distances between every point of one cluster to every other point of the other cluster.\n","\n","From the above given linkage methods, we can apply any of them according to the type of problem or business requirement.\n","\n","Let us now plot dendrogram for `animals_arr` dataset.\n","\n","**Plotting Dendrogram:**\n","\n","The `scipy.cluster` module equips us with tools that are needed for hierarchical clustering and dendrogram plotting.\n","\n","The dendrogram can be plotted easily using the linkage matrix. A linkage matrix is created via `linkage()` function. This matrix contains the distance between clusters based on the specified linkage method. Following is the syntax of `linkage()` function:\n","\n","`hierarchy.linkage(data, method= 'single')`\n","\n","Here,\n"," - `data:` The dataset (input 1D/2D array).\n"," - `method`: Linkage methods. Default value is `'single'`. Other values are `'complete'`, `'average'`, `'centroid'`, `'ward'`.\n","\n","Follow the steps given below to plot the dendrogram:\n","\n","1. Import `linkage` and `dendrogram` functions from `scipy.cluster.hierarchy` module.\n","2. Call `linkage()` function and pass `animals_arr` dataset and `method = single` as inputs. Store the returned linkage matrix in a variable `s_distances`.\n","3.  Plot the dendrogram by calling the `dendrogram()` function and pass the linkage matrix `s_distances` as input to this function. Also , pass `labels = animal_lbl` as input to `dendrogram()` function to label the data points on $x$-axis.\n","\n","4. Also, set the `xlabel` and `ylabel` of this dendrogram using `matplotlib.pyplot` module."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sMBrVuLH5RUm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":623},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718265559838,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":777,"user":{"displayName":"Taanush
