The United Nations (UN) and other countries declared access to safe drinking water as a fundamental human right. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level.\n","\n","You are provided with a dataset consisting of water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies. Your job is to  create a model to determine if the sample tested from the water body is fit for human consumption or not.\n","\n","Following are the attributes of this dataset:\n","\n","\n","1. `ph`: The pH value indicates the acidic or alkaline condition of water status. The pH of pure water is 7. WHO has recommended maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5.\n","\n","2. `Hardness`: Hardness is mainly caused by calcium and magnesium salts. These salts are dissolved from geologic deposits through which water travels.\n","\n","3. `Solids`: Also known as TDS (total dissolved solids). Water has the ability to dissolve a wide range of inorganic and some organic minerals or salts such as potassium, calcium, sodium, bicarbonates, etc. These minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted colour in appearance of water.  The water with high TDS value indicates that water is highly mineralized. Desirable limit for TDS is 500 mg/l and maximum limit is 1000 mg/l prescribed for drinking purposes.\n","\n","4. `Chloramines`: Chlorine and chloramine are the major disinfectants used in public water systems. Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Chlorine levels up to 4 milligrams per litre ($mg/L$ or 4 parts per million (ppm)) are considered safe in drinking water.\n","\n","5. `Sulfate`: Sulfates are naturally occurring substances that are found in minerals, soil, and rocks.  Sulfate concentration in seawater is about 2,700 milligrams per litre ($mg/L$). It ranges from 3 to 30 $mg/L$ in most freshwater supplies.\n","\n","\n","6. `Conductivity`: Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather’s a good insulator.  Electrical conductivity (EC) measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceed 400 micro siemens per centimetre ($\\mu S/cm$).\n","\n","7. `Organic_carbon`: Total Organic Carbon (TOC) is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water.\n","\n","8. `Trihalomethanes`: Trihalomethanes (THMs) are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine. THM levels up to 80 ppm is considered safe in drinking water.\n","\n","9. `Turbidity`: The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. The mean turbidity value obtained for Wondo Genet Campus (0.98 NTU) is lower than the WHO recommended value of 5.00 NTU.\n","\n","10. `Potability`: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where `1` means Potable and `0` means Not potable.\n","\n","\n","**Dataset Credits:** https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability\n","\n","**Dataset Link:**

If we try to identify the weight of ID11 based on the plot, we would say that since ID11 is closer to points `2` and `9`, so it must have a weight similar to these IDs. Let us find out how kNN algorithm  predicts the weight of ID11.\n","\n","**How kNN regression work?**\n","\n","In kNN, a new data point is assigned a value based on how closely it resembles the points in the training set. From our example, we know that ID11 has height and age similar to ID2 and ID9, so the weight would also approximately be the same.\n","\n","If we use kNN classifier in this case, it would assign the new data point ID11 to the class to which the majority of its nearest points belong. So the weight of ID11 would be equal to weight of either ID2 or ID9 (if $k = 2$).\n","\n","However, in kNN regression, the average of the values is taken to be the final prediction. Thus, the weight of ID11 would be the mean of weights of ID2 and ID9 (if $k = 2$) for kNN regression.\n","\n","Thus, kNN regression has the following basic steps:\n","\n","<center><img src= \"https://s3-whjr-v2-prod-bucket.whjr.online/whjr-v2-prod-bucket/11ad6a31-50bd-4ec4-aea0-e947a832e296.png\"/></center>\n","\n","Let us first calculate the distance between the new data point and each training point.
