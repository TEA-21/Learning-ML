They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.\n","\n","You can learn more about the Pulsar and neutron star by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrMvUL8HFlM).\n","\n","As pulsars rotate, their emission beam sweeps across the sky, and when this crosses our line of sight, it produces a detectable pattern of broadband radio emission. \n","\n","<img src='https://student-datasets-bucket.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/images/lightcurve_pulsar.gif'>\n","\n","Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of observation.\n","\n","Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. The classification algorithms, in particular, are being widely adopted, which treat the candidate datasets as binary classification problems (predict either `0` or `1`). Here, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class (less in numbers), and the remaining examples are a majority negative class.\n","\n","The class labels used are `0` (negative class) and `1` (positive class). Hence, **we need to deploy the XGBoost Classifier classification model which can accurately detect the class 1 examples.**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_wo1cHTIQxyv"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2_aRS4XTQw0N"},"source":["### Attribute Information\n","\n","Each candidate is described by 8 continuous variables and a single class variable. The first four are simple statistics obtained from the integrated pulse profile (folded profile). This is an array of continuous variables that describe a longitude-resolved version of the signal that has been averaged in both time and frequency. The remaining four variables are similarly obtained from the DM-SNR curve. **You do not have to worry about what they actually mean.** These 8 variables are summarised below:\n","\n","1. The mean of the integrated profile.\n","\n","2. The standard deviation of the integrated profile.\n","\n","3. Excess kurtosis of the integrated profile.\n","\n","4.
